Even in major TV stations shows, the moe concept became to be reported as one of the remarkable examples in the otaku culture (shown below). In addition, otakus’ severe online backlash against Banpresto[13], a Japanese toy company that filed 2 applications for trademark registration of the term “Zettai Ryouiki” in September of that year[14], also led the further increase of visibility of the concept among non-otaku internet users.

Not to be confused with gym uniforms in general, buruma refers to the specific underwear-like gym shorts part of the outfit. Despite no longer being used officially in present day, their close resemblance to underwear made them a common form of fanservice in anime and manga and kept them alive as a fetish item amongst its fanbase.","According to books on the history of Japanese sports,[1] buruma were introduced in Japan as women’s clothing for physical education in 1903. Initially introduced for ease of movement, the PE outfit changed its appearance several times throughout the 20th century.[2] The final change in appearance occured in the mid-1960s; resulting in the pittari (tight-fitting) buruma, which were a drastic minimazation from previous versions (shown below). This lead to the pittari buruma having the drawback of not always covering underwear. However, concerns over this were borne largely in silence until the early 1990s, when schools and individuals began to choose sports shorts instead due to the exponentially increasing modesty concerns; resulting in a rapid decrease in buruma use in the following decade. Nowadays, the usage of buruma as a required PE uniform in Japan has mostly disappeared.","The buruma’s revealing nature and close resemblance to underwear lead to the bloomer becoming a popular type of clothing fetish. Despite it no longer being used officially, the piece has survived through anime and manga where it’s frequently used as a form of fanservice; this also resulted in the piece frequently being promoted and sold as a form of cosplay. Although the fetish commonly extends itself to the PE outfit, its popularity has remained the most consistent throughout its characteristic bottom piece. Additionally, buruma fanworks often feature additional elements, most notably having the character wear a track jacket over the shirt or thigh-highs instead of socks (shown below)."

Originating from the hip hop scene in Atlanta, Georgia, the dance became mainstream popular after numerous professional football players adopted it as a celebratory gesture during games in August 2015.","While “The Dab” trend is generally believed to have originated from Atlanta, Georgia’s hip-hop scene sometime during the first half of 2015[1], the question of who invented the dance move remains in dispute among several Atlanta-based hip hop artists and collectives, many of whom are affiliated with the record label Quality Control Music, including Migos, OG Maco, Skippa Da Flippa and Rich The Kid. According to Migos’ member Quavo, the dance has been gaining traction in Atlanta’s local hip-hop scene since as early as 2013, although it didn’t reach the tipping point on Internet hip hop communities until the local rappers began releasing songs and music videos that either feature the dance or lyrical references to The Dab during the summer of 2015, most notably Skippa Da Flippa’s “How Fast Can You Count It"" and Migos’ “Look at My Dab” (shown below).",Tutorials
