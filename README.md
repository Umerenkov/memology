**Memes - why so popular?**


This project is dedicated to the greatest achievement of humanity - Memes. Finding out the popularity of a meme based on its description and some other data from [KnowYourMemes.com](KnowYourMemes.com) sounds like a great idea for me. Wow.

Parser outputs a csv file with the following fields:
- *name* - name of the glorious meme
- *added* - date the masterpiece was added to the site
- *views* - how many mere mortals have witnessed the meme
- *comments* - number of those, who dares to express their opinions
- *status* - if the meme has been approved
- *year* - year of the appearence of the origin of the meme
- *tags* - what tags have been given to the meme
- *about* - description
- *origin* - after all we all came from dust. But not the Memes
- *spread* - usually an empty fiels, sometimes it says what is the area of spread of the meme

### What is next?
Cleaning, preprocessing, bag-o-wording, Word2vecing, modelling and, of course, having tons of fun!
